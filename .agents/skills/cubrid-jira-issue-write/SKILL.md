# CUBRID JIRA Issue Writer

Write a CUBRID JIRA issue that QA, decision-makers, and developers can understand without reading a code-level design document.

Read [`tone_guide.md`](./tone_guide.md) before drafting. It is authoritative for wording, detail level, and JIRA wiki markup.

## Output

- Save the paste-ready body under `.git_ignored_dir/jira/<TICKET_KEY>/CBRD-XXXXX-short-slug.md`.
- Use the ticket key from the argument or current branch. Use `CBRD-XXXXX` for an unfiled draft.
- The file extension is `.md`, but its contents are JIRA wiki markup, not Markdown.
- Write only the JIRA Description field body in the file. Do not put the proposed Summary/title in it.
- In the completion message, report the file path, issue type, and proposed Summary separately.
- If `.git_ignored_dir/jira/` does not exist, stop and ask the user to create it. The per-ticket directory may be created as needed.

## Choose the template by work, not hierarchy

Choose the template that matches the actual work. A Sub-task inherits the template for its work:

- Bug or incorrect behavior: `Correct Error`
- Feature, performance improvement, or refactoring: `Improve Function/Performance, Development Subject, Refactoring`
- Internal administration or a Task that fits neither category: `Internal Management`

Ask only when the issue type cannot be determined from the conversation, source material, or existing JIRA context.

## Templates

Use the labels and order below. Mark section labels with JIRA bold syntax such as `*Description*`.

### Correct Error

```text
*Description*

*Test Build*

*Repro*

*Expected Result*

*Actual Result*

*Additional Information*
```

- `Description`: Describe the failure situation and its visible impact in one to three short paragraphs. Do not include root-cause analysis, call paths, backtraces, or a proposed code change.
- `Test Build`: Record the exact affected build through patch/revision and commit, for example `CUBRID-11.0.0.0248-b53ae4a` or the exact `cubrid_rel` output. Add the OS only when useful. Never invent missing build data.
- `Repro`: Give the smallest complete copy-paste procedure that reproduces the problem. It may be long when the required schema, SQL, command, or attached program is long. Do not add the developer's broader regression or debugging plan.
- `Expected Result`: State the expected result briefly.
- `Actual Result`: State the observed result and enough comparison data to recognize the failure. Keep implementation analysis out.
- `Additional Information`: Include only material that helps understand or investigate the bug. Omit this section when there is nothing useful to add.

### Improve Function/Performance, Development Subject, Refactoring

```text
*Description*

*Specification Changes*

*Implementation*

*Acceptance Criteria*

*Definition of done*
```

- `Description`: Explain the current limitation, its impact, and the intended improvement in one to three short paragraphs.
- `Specification Changes`: Describe user-visible behavior, supported and excluded cases, settings, compatibility, and other facts needed by QA or manual writers. Use `N/A` when no specification changes exist. There is no fixed length limit when a support matrix, SQL example, or constraint list is necessary.
- `Implementation`: State only the central implementation concept and affected scope in one to three short paragraphs. Do not enumerate function-by-function flow, data structures, file/line changes, pseudocode, internal error paths, or a detailed test design.
- `Acceptance Criteria`: Give at most three observable results that determine whether the work is acceptable. Do not repeat the specification section.
- `Definition of done`: Normally include only `Acceptance Criteria를 만족한다.` and, when applicable, `QA 테스트를 통과한다.`

Never invent a performance target. Use a number only when the user or an authoritative source supplied the target and its basis. If a numeric target is essential but missing, ask the user.

### Internal Management

```text
*Description*
```

Explain the purpose and scope in one to three short paragraphs. Do not manufacture specification, implementation, or verification sections for internal work.

## Supporting analysis

Do not create an analysis attachment by default. Create one only when:

- the user requests it;
- existing backtraces, call paths, root-cause analysis, or detailed verification records are worth preserving; or
- omitting the evidence would leave the responsible developer without necessary context.

Keep it in the ticket directory and reference it briefly from `Additional Information`. Attachments may contain developer-only detail that does not belong in the JIRA body.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the ticket key and issue type.
2. Read relevant user material, source code, analysis, and existing JIRA context. Prefer checking available evidence over asking the user.
3. Ask only for missing facts that materially affect correctness, such as the issue type, exact repro, changed specification, or an agreed performance target.
4. Draft the minimum complete body using the appropriate template and `tone_guide.md`.
5. Save the body and any justified attachment.
6. Verify the structure, JIRA markup, verbosity, and absence of invented details before reporting the result.

`grill-with-docs` is not mandatory. Use it only when the user requests it.
