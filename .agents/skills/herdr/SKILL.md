description: "Control Herdr, a terminal multiplexer for coding agents. Use only when the user explicitly mentions Herdr or asks to use Herdr to inspect or control panes, tabs, workspaces, commands, or another agent. Do not use merely because a task could benefit from a background terminal, delegation, or parallel work. Supports an internal caller or an external coordinator targeting an explicit session."

# Herdr

Herdr organizes terminals into workspaces, tabs, and panes, recognizes coding agents running inside panes, and exposes the current session through the `herdr` CLI.

## Select the connection mode

- **Internal caller (`HERDR_ENV=1`):** use the inherited session and caller pane as described below.
- **External coordinator (including Codex app-server):** no inherited Herdr environment is required. Discover running sessions with `herdr session list`, then use `herdr --session <name>` for EVERY subsequent control command. Select the sole running session when unambiguous; if multiple sessions could match the task, ask which one to use. Do not invent `HERDR_ENV` or caller IDs.

For external coordination, list workspaces and panes in the selected session. Resolve the target by the explicit user target or an unambiguous task cwd match; ask when ambiguous. Use explicit returned pane IDs in place of `--current` or `$HERDR_PANE_ID` throughout the examples below. Never use UI focus as caller identity. Keep the selected session and IDs together for the entire delegation.

Codex may stay outside Herdr while Claude workers run inside it. Create a sibling of the resolved task pane, preserve the task cwd, use `--no-focus`, and start Claude with `--kind claude -- --model sonnet` when the task requires Sonnet. Existing agents are not automatically available for new work; create a worker unless reuse is authorized.

### External coordinator example

Replace placeholders with the selected running session and IDs returned by that session. Inspect layout before choosing the split direction.

```bash
herdr --session <name> pane layout --pane <task-pane-id>
herdr --session <name> pane split --pane <task-pane-id> --direction down --cwd <task-cwd> --no-focus
herdr --session <name> agent start <unique-name> --kind claude --pane <returned-pane-id> -- --model sonnet
herdr --session <name> agent prompt <unique-name> "<bounded task and execution contract>" --wait --timeout 45000
herdr --session <name> agent read <unique-name> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

If the bounded wait times out, inspect state and continue waiting in bounded intervals; timeout is not completion. Read the final report before declaring success.

The remaining unprefixed examples illustrate **internal-caller mode**. External coordinators must apply the explicit session prefix and pane-ID substitutions described above.

## Learn the current CLI

The installed binary is the authority for command syntax. Start with:

```bash
herdr --help
```

Then print the relevant command group by running the group without a subcommand:

```bash
herdr agent
herdr pane
herdr workspace
herdr tab
herdr worktree
herdr terminal
herdr notification
herdr integration
herdr session
```

Do not run bare `herdr` for discovery; it launches or attaches the TUI. Do not probe a mutating nested command by omitting arguments. Commands such as `herdr workspace create` are valid with defaults and will execute.

Most control commands return JSON. Read identifiers and state from those responses instead of predicting them.

## Understand layout, panes, and agents

Choose the primitive that matches the job:

- Workspace, tab, and pane topology organize terminal locations.
- Pane commands control raw terminals, shells, tests, servers, input, and output.
- Agent commands control the recognized coding agent currently occupying a pane.

A pane exists whether or not it contains an agent. `agent start` requires an existing available shell pane and never creates, splits, or moves layout. Use pane commands for ordinary processes. Use agent commands when Herdr must validate agent identity or interpret `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, `done`, and `unknown` lifecycle states.

Agent commands accept either a unique live agent name or the pane ID currently hosting that agent. They do not accept terminal IDs or bare agent-kind labels. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` and be unique among live agents. A name follows the current pane occupant and is cleared when that agent exits, is released, or is replaced.

`idle` means the agent is ready for input and its tab has been seen in the focused Herdr UI. `done` is the same underlying idle state after unseen background work finishes. Focusing the tab or targeting the pane or agent with a focus command marks it seen. CLI reads do not mark it seen. `blocked` means Herdr recognized an approval or question UI. `unknown` means an agent is present but Herdr cannot classify it confidently; it does not prove completion.

## Use IDs and caller context

Public IDs are opaque stable handles:

- workspace: `w1`
- tab: `w1:t1`
- pane: `w1:p1`

Closed tab and pane IDs are not reused. A pane moved into another workspace receives a new workspace-qualified pane ID. After `pane move`, continue with `.result.move_result.pane.pane_id` or the live agent name. The old value is reported as `.result.move_result.previous_pane_id`; only the moved process's inherited caller context keeps resolving that old ID, so do not use it as a general agent target.

Herdr injects the caller's context into each managed pane:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID" "$HERDR_TAB_ID" "$HERDR_PANE_ID"
```

Prefer `--current` when a pane command should target the calling pane. Omitting a target may use the UI-focused pane, which can belong to the user or another client.

Discover live state with:

```bash
herdr workspace list
herdr tab list --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID"
herdr pane current --current
herdr pane list --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID"
herdr agent list
```

Creation responses expose the IDs to use next. `workspace create` returns `.result.workspace`, `.result.tab`, and `.result.root_pane`. `tab create` returns `.result.tab` and `.result.root_pane`. `pane split` returns the new pane as `.result.pane`.

## Start and coordinate an agent

Default to a sibling pane in the resolved task tab and the task working directory. Do not create a workspace, tab, worktree, or different cwd unless the user explicitly requests that topology or location.

Honor a direction requested by the user. Otherwise inspect the caller pane:

```bash
herdr pane layout --pane "$HERDR_PANE_ID"
```

Split a wide pane to the right and a narrow or tall pane down. Avoid repeated same-direction splits that create unusably narrow columns or short rows. Keep the user's focus in the calling pane and explicitly preserve the caller's working directory:

```bash
herdr pane split --current --direction right --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus
```

Replace `right` with `down` when appropriate. Read the new pane ID from `.result.pane.pane_id`.

An available shell pane must be at its interactive prompt, with the shell itself in the foreground and no foreground command, editor, or agent running. Start a supported agent in that pane with a useful unique name:

```bash
herdr agent start reviewer --kind codex --pane <returned-pane-id>
```

Use the kind requested by the user. Run `herdr agent` to inspect the installed kind list and options. Pass native agent arguments only after `--`:

```bash
herdr agent start reviewer --kind codex --pane <returned-pane-id> -- <agent-args...>
```

A successful `agent start` returns only after Herdr detects the expected agent in the same pane and considers it ready for interactive input. If the agent is blocked during startup, the command returns `agent_not_ready` immediately but keeps the name available for `agent read` and `agent send-keys`. Wait until the agent becomes idle before prompting it. Startup defaults to a 30-second timeout.

Submit work through the agent surface:

```bash
herdr agent prompt reviewer "Review the current diff and report only actionable findings." --wait --timeout 120000
```

`agent prompt` honors the pane's live bracketed-paste mode and sends text followed by encoded Enter after a short delay. It rejects an agent already waiting at an approval or question dialog with `agent_blocked` before sending any input. Inspect the blocked UI and ask the user before answering it. For normal agent work, `--wait` is enough: it waits for the first settled `idle`, `done`, or `blocked` state. Do not repeat those defaults with `--until`.

A prompt sent from a non-working state must produce an observed lifecycle change within five seconds. Otherwise Herdr returns `agent_prompt_stalled` instead of waiting indefinitely. This wait tracks lifecycle state, not an individual turn; if the agent is already working, completion of the active turn may satisfy it.

Use `--until` only for a state-specific workflow, such as waiting for an already-running agent to request input:

```bash
herdr agent wait reviewer --until blocked --timeout 120000
```

Without `--until`, standalone `agent wait` uses the same settled-state defaults as `agent prompt --wait`.

Use logical keys for interactive agent UI controls:

```bash
herdr agent send-keys reviewer esc
herdr agent send-keys reviewer ctrl+c
```

Herdr validates all keys before writing any bytes. Read the result through the resolved agent:

```bash
herdr agent get reviewer
herdr agent read reviewer --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

If a wait fails or returns `blocked`, inspect `agent get` and `agent read` before deciding what input to send. Use the pane surface only when raw terminal control is intentional.

## Run an ordinary command in another pane

Create a sibling pane with the same geometry rule, preserve the caller's working directory, and keep user focus unchanged:

```bash
herdr pane split --current --direction right --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus
```

Read the new pane ID from `.result.pane.pane_id`, then run and inspect the command:

```bash
herdr pane run <returned-pane-id> "just test"
herdr pane wait-output <returned-pane-id> --match "test result" --timeout 120000
herdr pane read <returned-pane-id> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

`pane run` atomically sends command text and Enter. `pane wait-output` searches the selected snapshot immediately, so output that already exists can match. Use `--match <text>` for a literal substring or `--regex <pattern>` for a Rust regular expression. Omitting `--timeout` allows an indefinite wait.

Use the read source that matches the task:

- `visible`: the currently rendered viewport.
- `recent`: recent rendered output, including soft wraps.
- `recent-unwrapped`: recent output with soft wraps joined; prefer it for logs and transcripts.
- `detection`: the plain-text bottom-buffer snapshot used for agent detection.

Use `--format ansi` when colors and terminal styling are evidence. Otherwise use text.

`--lines` asks Herdr for more rows from the pane's available screen and host scrollback. If increasing it does not reveal more of a completed response, the pane is probably running the agent on the terminal's alternate screen. Rows that leave the alternate screen do not enter Herdr's host scrollback, so a larger line count cannot recover them.

After that failed read, ask the agent to write its complete response as Markdown in the tooling repository's `.git_ignored_dir/scratch/` directory and reply only with the file path, then read the file directly. Use this only as a fallback; do not request file output in the initial prompt.

## Finish and clean up workers

After a worker finishes, read and preserve its final report before closing its pane. Close every worker pane created for the completed task with `herdr --session <selected-name> pane close <created-pane-id>` (internal callers may use the inherited session). Verify with `pane list` that those panes are gone. This ends the live Claude process; keep saved report artifacts. Do not leave idle workers open unless the user asks to keep them for reuse.

Track created pane IDs when starting workers. Close only those panes, never pre-existing user agents or the whole Herdr session. If a worker is still working or blocked, resolve or report its status before cleanup; do not label an interrupted task complete.

## Safety and coordination rules

- Use `--no-focus` for background work unless the user asked to switch context.
- Use `--current`, an explicit pane ID, or a unique agent name. Do not rely on another client's focused pane.
- Parse IDs from JSON responses. Do not derive them from sidebar order or examples.
- Do not close workspaces, tabs, panes, or sessions you did not create unless the user explicitly asked.
- Never run `herdr server stop` from an active session unless the user explicitly intends to stop the server and its pane processes.
- Never kill the main Herdr process. Use named test sessions for experiments that need an isolated server.
- CLI server errors are JSON on stderr with exit status 1. CLI syntax errors exit with status 2.
